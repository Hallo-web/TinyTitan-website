        <p>Fully responsive CSS flip book, thanks to the <code>cqmin</code> unit.</p>

        <p>Even more, the book height is dicated by the amount of content in the tallest page.
          The only thing you need to take care of is how much text you put into a page.</p>

        <h2>JS at its minimum</h2>
        <p>JavaScript is at its minimum. Basically it's only used to set the initial
          page index and assign click listeners to the pages. Modifies the CSS <b>Var</b>
          for the <i>current</i> page, and the rest is handled entirely by CSS.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="back">
        <p>Additionally JavaScript allows you to click on an anchor link in your
          text â€” without turning the page. You can also have multiple independent
          flip books in a single document. You're all covered.</p>

        <h2>Crafting CSS magic</h2>
        <p>The opened (<i>viewing</i>) pages of the flip book are always kept at the same elevation.
        This is necessary if your book has no inclination (is top-down-view).
        Have you noticed that you can also click on the pages edge? CSS will nicely animate the group
          of pages to skip with a staggered animation.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="back">
        <p>Like in this demo, you can change the perspective of the parent container and change the
          X axis rotation of the book for extra effect.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="page">
      <div class="front">
        <p>The necessary FlipBook's CSS is barely 30 lines, there is no swipe, natural page flip angling,
          complex shadows, etc. in order to keep it as simple as possible.</p>

      <div class="back">
        <p>Feel free to use and abuse this code. Drop me a line if you find it cool or useful, or just
          want to say <i>hi</i>.</p>
